## working with DOM elements and events. Execute code at given intervals.
### task...
Create an HTML page with a number field, a button, and a div element with the number 0.
The number of seconds should be entered in the input field, and the button should start the timer. When the timer starts, the number in the div element should be replaced by the one entered in the field. Then every second it should decrease by one until it reaches 0.
At the same time, the timer should work correctly if the user restarts it during its operation.
